A Dynamic DNS Server for Docker.

This is quickly hacked-together Ruby script for a DNS server that
automatically inserts A-Records for link:http://docker.com[Docker]
containers. It listens to
link:https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#events[docker
events] and dynamically adds or removes containers from the DNS server.
Only IP address and host name (set by the --hostname parameter) are
published. An upstream server is used to look up any non-docker host names.

I created this for simple development scenarios, where I don't need the full
power of something like
link:https://github.com/crosbymichael/skydock[SkyDock] or
link:https://github.com/bnfinet/docker-dns[docker-dns]. Also, I wanted to
play around :-)

It's based on link:https://github.com/ioquatix/rubydns[RubyDNS] and is
inspired by above projects, as well as

blog post].
